        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When the first COVID case was reported, the patient was quarantined and placed under medical
          surveillance. This protocol was followed for all other cases as well, with people being
          quarantined. Unfortunately, there were deaths. The world was shaken by the impact of this
          deadly virus, especially for certain groups such as the elderly and individuals with underlying
          health conditions.

          Despite top-tier countries running out of oxygen, respective governments made efforts to
          import oxygen. Some countries also exported tablets and medicines to help control fever in
          other countries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Scientists extensively explored the virus, conducted research, and found different vaccines.
          They performed preclinical testing and, after many iterations, successfully developed a vaccine
          that could prevent the spread of COVID by building a defense in our immune system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Instead of this, imagine quarantining people who are infected by COVID and killing them.
          Imagine government ordering to shoot people who have the virus so that we could prevent it
          from spreading. Well, not only would we have lost double the number of people, but we would
          also still be in a complete lockdown.

          Now let's talk about sexual offenders and perpetrators of sexual assault. I was trying to get a
          number on this but it is challenging to provide an exact number of people who are sexually
          harassed per minute worldwide because sexual harassment is often underreported due to social
          stigma.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-6 py-2 my-6 italic text-gray-600">
          1 in 3 women globally experience violence. Every 68 seconds, an American is sexually
          assaulted. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every
          1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          If one person experiences sexual harassment every 68 seconds in America, imagine the scale of
          the issue worldwide. Sexual harassment has unfortunately become as common as a fever. One
          incident that stands out is the case in Chennai - Maraikkuma Nenjam, where reports of sexual
          harassment and molestation surfaced. It was shocking to think that such incidents could occur
          even in a concert setting. Social media X was flooded with posts expressing not only
          disappointment, but also sharing stories of women who had experienced sexual molestation.

          We have, especially in India we have severe punishment. (1) Whoever, except in the cases
          provided for in sub-section (2), shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment of
          either description for a term which [shall not be less than ten years, but which may extend to
          imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine].

          In India, there are counseling and rehabilitation programs available for individuals in prison,
          including those incarcerated for rape cases. They say they have Psychological Counseling,
          Legal Assistance, De-addiction Programs and Rehabilitation Programs. All these programs
          promote to something called cure rather than prevention.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I always wonder how we, as humans, have successfully found preventive vaccinations for
          several viruses. This achievement comes after years of studying their behavior, patterns, and
          mutability of a virus. Why couldn't we study humans, our own kind? Why do people rape? Why
          do they sexually harass women? What is the pattern here? What kind of trauma leads someone
          to commit these kinds of offenses? Even after so many years, should we not have figured out
          the pattern by now and started implementing preventive measures? Or is it the other way
          around? Have we identified the pattern, behavior, and triggers that lead to rape/harassment but
          failed to take action?
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I don't know....</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          As we grapple with these profound questions about the root causes of such heinous acts, we
          must acknowledge that the complexity of human behavior and societal issues cannot be
          reduced to simple patterns or triggers. The quest to understand and prevent sexual harassment
          and rape remains a multifaceted challenge.
